# Collaborative work

Git allows for collaborative work on code. You are able to share repositories with others and then make changes on _branches_. A branch is a version of the code that is unique to you. All collaborators can create and edit branches which can then be _merged_ with a _pull request_.

## Terminology

- **Clone** - A copy of the repo that is downloaded to your computer. This is a way to copy files without emailing `.zip` files between editors.
- **Branch** - A version of your work that is separate from any other branch. Branches are  generally used to build new features, fix bugs, or to refactor old code.
- **Commit** - saving a snapshot of your work. The commit message describes the changes that were made.
- **Push** - publish your changes back to your repository.
- **Pull Request** - Send a request to the owner of the main repository to include your code in the project. This opens a discussion thread which can be used to accept your incoming changes, request fixes to changes you're suggesting, or to discuss your ideas.

## Task

For this task, you will:
- **Fork** (copy) this repo to your own account.
- **Clone** your fork to your Chromebook
- Edit, save, and **commit** your changes
- **Push** your work back to your repository
- Create a **pull request** which allows the owner to review your changes.

### Procedure 1: Fork and clone the main repo

1. Click on the **Fork** button to make a copy on your account.
2. Open VS Code and use Shift + Ctrl + P to open the command pallete.
3. Type Git:Clone
4. Sign into Github (only necessary once).
5. Choose this repository to clone.
6. Select your repo and choose where to save your files.

### Procedure 2: Write a reflection

1. Create a file saved as `your_last_name.md`. For example, mine would be `Bennett.md`.
2. Write a reflection on what you've learned so far this year. Make it a narrative - what are you enjoying? What did you not like very much? What do you feel good at? What do you need to improve on?
3. When you're finished, commit your changes with a clear message about what you changed.

### Procedure 3: Publish and make a pull request

1. After you've committed your changes, push your code back to your repository. Reload the page on Github to make sure the changes are there.
2. On your repo page, click on **Pull Requests**.
3. Click on the green "New pull request" button on the top right.
4. The base repository should be the main repo you cloned from.
5. Write a message explaining what you're wanting to change.
6. Click on "Create pull request."
